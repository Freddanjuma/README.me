## Database Design

### Entities & Fields

#### Users
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `user_type`  
- A user can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

#### Properties
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`  
- A property belongs to a user and can have many bookings and reviews.

#### Bookings
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`  
- Each booking links a user to a property for a date range.

#### Reviews
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
- A user can review a property after booking it.

#### Payments
- `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`  
- Each payment is associated with one booking.

## API Security

### Authentication
Secured using JWT tokens for user identity verification.

### Authorization
Role-based access control ensures actions match user permissions.

### Data Validation
Input data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

### HTTPS and Headers
Secures data in transit and adds protection with security headers.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting repeated requests to critical endpoints.

### Payment Security
Payment data is handled via PCI-compliant third-party services.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD automates code testing and deployment, ensuring stability and speed in the development process.

### Why It Matters
- Detects issues early through automated testing
- Reduces deployment errors and manual steps
- Speeds up the delivery of new features

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Runs tests and deploys code after each commit.
- **Docker**: Packages the app for consistent deployment.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render**: Optional platforms for production hosting.
